           <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
          
           <h3>Cannabis Supply Chain</h3>
           <p>The cannabis supply chain consists of five main stages: Cultivation, Manufacturing, Distribution, Transportation, and Retail.</p>
           <p>Track and Trace systems are used throughout the supply chain for compliance.</p>


           <h4>Cultivation</h4>
           <p>Cultivation involves six stages:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Germination</li>
               <li>Seeding</li>
               <li>Vegetative</li>
               <li>Pre-flowering</li>
               <li>Flowering</li>
               <li>Harvesting</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Post-harvest processes include drying, curing, and trimming.</p>
          
           <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
           <p>Manufacturing involves several steps:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Extraction (solvent and non-solvent methods)</li>
               <li>Light manufacturing (packaging, pre-rolls)</li>
               <li>Infusion (for edibles)</li>
           </ul>
          
           <h4>Distribution</h4>
           <p>Distribution challenges include:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>State-specific regulations</li>
               <li>Restrictions on vehicle size</li>
               <li>Prohibition of interstate transport</li>
               <li>Intra-state transport regulations</li>
           </ul>
          
           <h4>Transportation</h4>
           <p>Transportation requires specific licenses and is heavily regulated. Testing is crucial for compliance and includes:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Contamination checks</li>
               <li>Pesticide screening</li>
               <li>Potency testing</li>
               <li>Terpene profiling</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Quality Assurance ensures proper packaging and labeling.</p>
          
           <h4>Retail</h4>
           <p>Retail (dispensaries) face challenges such as:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Product sampling and knowledge</li>
               <li>Compliance concerns</li>
               <li>Finding vendors (state-restricted)</li>
               <li>Competition from the black market</li>
           </ul>
           <p>The industry is heavily regulated, with serious consequences for non-compliance.</p>


           <h3>Environmental Concerns in Cannabis Production</h3>
           <p>Key environmental concerns in cannabis production include:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>High energy use for indoor grows (lighting, heating/cooling, dehumidifying, ventilation)</li>
               <li>Water intensity, especially in drier environments</li>
               <li>Pesticide misuse and overuse, which pose risks to workers, consumers, and the environment</li>
           </ul>
          
           <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
           <h4>Land Use</h4>
           <p>Better planning of cultivation sites to minimize negative environmental impacts, including:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Land use planning strategies to regulate the location and size of new farming areas</li>
               <li>Relocating existing farms onto more suitable land</li>
               <li>Implementing wildlife-conscious farming practices to prevent negative impacts on wildlife</li>
               <li>Urban zoning policies to ensure vulnerable communities are not disproportionately affected</li>
           </ul>


           <h4>Water Use</h4>
           <p>Effective water management is crucial, especially since large amounts of cannabis are grown in semi-arid/drought-prone environments. Strategies include:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Establishing water licensing systems</li>
               <li>Incentivizing efficient water usage</li>
               <li>Using rainwater storage, automated irrigation, and water treatment and reuse strategies</li>
           </ul>


           <h4>Pesticide Use</h4>
           <p>To address pesticide use, policy changes should include:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Developing rigorous testing standards for contaminants in cannabis products</li>
               <li>Certifying and educating producers on alternative pest control methods</li>
               <li>Incentivizing producers to avoid illegal chemicals</li>
               <li>Implementing thorough supply chain tracing and environmental monitoring to prevent sourcing from illegal markets</li>
               <li>Encouraging the use of biologically derived pesticide products and integrated pest management methods</li>
           </ul>


           <h4>Energy Use</h4>
           <p>To manage energy use, regulations should require:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Growers to submit energy plans that comply with existing standards</li>
               <li>Reports on energy usage</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Best practices include prioritizing energy-efficient light sources, renewable energy, and scheduling operations around peak demand times.</p>


           <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
           <p>To reduce air pollution, policies should focus on:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Issuing permits based on ozone-formation simulations</li>
               <li>Ensuring transparency regarding BVOCs (Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds) and masking agents related to human health in cultivation facilities</li>
               <li>Utilizing carbon filtration and closed-loop cannabis extraction systems</li>
           </ul>

                    <li>Efficient water extraction timing and amounts</li>
                    <li>Incentivizing efficient water usage</li>
                    <li>Methods like rainwater storage, automated irrigation, and water treatment and reuse to reduce waste</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pesticide Use</h3>
                <p>Sustainable practices for pesticide use include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rigorous testing standards for contaminants</li>
                    <li>Certification schemes and education for producers on alternative pest control methods</li>
                    <li>Incentives to avoid the use of illegal chemicals</li>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project, developed by Diana Tran, Joey Kang, Tammy Nguyen, Jackson Enquist, and Max Wang for ENVIR 420, focuses on the production and distribution of sustainable cannabis.</p>
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                The production and distribution of sustainable cannabis is a crucial area of study considering the rapidly growing cannabis industry and its numerous environmental impacts. Current growing practices utilize lots of energy, water, and chemicals, proving to be incredibly resource intensive. This is where sustainable cannabis production shines as it incorporates practices that minimize the use of resources and, as a result, the environmental harm it does. Cannabis growing has shown little to no signs of slowing down due to its high demand, which is why it’s important to employ sustainable measures to keep consumers happy, while also stimulating the economy and protecting the environment. Some of these methods include organic farming, using renewable energy sources, conserving water when possible, and alternative pest management methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is obvious that the cannabis industry has many potential ways to reduce its carbon footprint and conserve natural resources, which is why our project focuses on this topic. By focusing on sustainable practices, we can explore viable practices that create minimal environmental harm while promoting the economy. Our project connects to sustainability by examining how eco-friendly agricultural practices can be applied to cannabis production, which reduces the industry's carbon footprint. Sustainable production not only benefits the environment but also supports social and economic sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe this topic is important because the cannabis industry has the potential to significantly impact the environment, both positively and negatively. As legalization continues to expand, it is important to recognize and address the environmental concerns that cannabis growing promotes in its current state. Cannabis growing of the past prioritized discrete growing methods over environmental concerns and it’s time to start a shift in the current growing methods. By researching and developing this project, we hope to contribute to a more sustainable future.

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
                To engage with our research on the production and distribution of sustainable cannabis, we plan to employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. We plan to perform a thorough review of existing literature and case studies on sustainable agricultural practices and their application in cannabis cultivation. Our findings will be compiled and presented through an interactive website. This website will serve as a comprehensive resource, featuring sections on the environmental impact of traditional cannabis cultivation, sustainable alternatives, and their benefits. By using a website as our medium, we aim to make our research accessible to a wide audience, fostering awareness and encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices within the cannabis industry.
